### Java Tomasulo's Algorithm with Swing GUI
This project is a Java implementation of Tomasulo's algorithm, a dynamic instruction scheduling algorithm used in computer processors to improve performance. 
The project also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) built using the Swing library for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.

##Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

*Java SE 8 or later

##Installation

To install and set up this project:

Clone the repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/Romiest/Tomasulo-Algorithm.git`


##Usage

To run the project, navigate to the `Tomasulo.java` file and run it

This will launch the GUI, which allows you to input instructions and see the execution of the algorithm in real-time.

##example
 
1-Enter the instructions in the input field, one instruction per line. For example :-

` L.D F0,100
S.D F1,50
ADD.D F3,F1,F2
MUL.D F1,F2,F4
SUB.D F4,F8,F9
DIV.D F10,F11,F12
S.D F1,106 `

2- click the ` Run Tomasulo ` button to start execution

3- you can navigate through the different cycles by clicking the `next` and `prev` cycles buttons.



 hope this documentation helps users understand and use your Java project implementing Tomasulo's algorithm with a Swing GUI. 
 Let me know if you have any questions or need any further assistance.  :)
